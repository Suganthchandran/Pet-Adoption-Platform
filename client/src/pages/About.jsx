          Cuddly Animalia Society (CAS) was started in 2006 to address animal welfare in the city of Coimbatore, and to carry out the critical function of Animal Birth Control (ABC). HAS is a public non-profit organisation registered with the Government of Tamil Nadu as a trust under certificate no. 998/2006 under section 12A (a) of the IT act 1961. Consequently, all financial contributions are tax-exempt under section 80(g).

          CAS is a group of people who believe that the power of compassion, love, and kindness will make a meaningful and positive difference to the lives of the animals around us. We strive to rescue, treat, rehabilitate, feed, and love the animals that need us the most.
          The mission statement of CAS is to mitigate animal suffering through humane ABC, rescue, treatment & rehabilitation.
          To spread awareness about animal rights through education in schools. To empower humans by providing them with a platform
          to contribute to the cause in their own unique way. Our vision is of a compassionate society where exploitation and abuse of animals is a thing of the past, and a future where all animals can claim their place on this Earth.

          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            At CAS, we believe that every pet deserves a loving home, and every family can be enriched by the unconditional love of a companion animal.
            Our journey began with a simple mission: to give vulnerable animals a second chance at life, and to match them with caring people who are ready
            to open their hearts and homes.
          </p>
          <p>
            It all started when our founder, [name], rescued a stray dog named [Dog's Name]. Left alone and scared, [Dog's Name] transformed into a playful,
            loyal companion after finding the love and care he needed. This experience opened our eyes to the thousands of animals waiting in shelters, on the streets,
            or in unsafe situations, longing for the same chance. We knew we had to do something.
